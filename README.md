# 🐱‍🏍 **React Pokédex**

## **Hey there! 👋**

Welcome to my **React Pokédex!** This project was built as part of my learning journey in React, following a fantastic tutorial by **smoljames** ([his website](#)). The app showcases the original **150 Pokémon** by fetching data from an external API. Whether you're a **Pokémon fan** or just curious about how to build a React app with API integration, this project is for you!
